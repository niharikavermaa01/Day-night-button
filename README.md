This project is a simple **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** web page with a toggle button that switches between **Day Mode** ☀️ and **Night Mode** 🌙.  
It’s a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to use JavaScript to change themes dynamically. I have tried to write a simplest code for this without using any AI tool. 

## 📌 Features
- **Day/Night Mode Toggle** button  
- Smooth background and text color transition  
- Beginner-friendly code, easy to customize

- `index.html` → The main webpage  
- `style.css` → Stylesheet for design and layout
